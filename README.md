# Large Language Model Projects
This repository contains projects and experiments with large language models including finetuning, data preparation, prompt engineering, and model deployment.

## Contents
- Models: Information on the LLMs used
- Finetuning: End-to-end examples of finetuning models on downstream tasks
- Data: Code for preparing datasets and analyzing data
- Prompts: Experiments on prompt engineering and tuning
- Deployment: Tools and code for deploying models as APIs and services
- Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks documenting experiments and results

## Models
List the major LLMs that will be used, with links to model hubs/repositories:
- Mistral
- Airoboros
- Synthia
- Llama
- GPT

  
## Finetuning
This section will detail end-to-end examples of finetuning models, including:
- Data loading/preparation
- Configuration and hyperparameter tuning
- Training loop
- Evaluation
- Exporting and loading finetuned models

## Data
Code for downloading datasets, analyzing and visualizing data, etc will live here.

## Prompts
Experiments and techniques for optimizing prompts to get the best performance from LLMs.

## Deployment
Examples of deploying finetuned models or prompt-based models as services, such as:
- REST APIs with Flask/FastAPI
- Web demos with Streamlit
- Serverless functions with AWS Lambda

## Notebooks
Jupyter notebooks providing running documentation of key experiments and results.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute examples, improvements, or fixes, please open an issue or PR!
